<h3> Curry to stay with Warriors </h3>

    Curry will sign a four-year deal worth $215 million with the Warriors, his agent told ESPN. <br> <br>
    He will be the first player in NBA history to sign two contracts worth more than $200 million. <br> <br>
    Anthony confirmed reports he will sign with the Lakers with a social media post changing the "L" in "Melo" to the "L" of the 
    Lakers' logo. <br> <br>
    The moves came on the second day of NBA free agency for the 2021-22 campaign. Teams cannot confirm deals or sign players until 
    Friday. <br> <br>
    Seven-time All-Star Curry, a 33-year-old guard, was the NBA's Most Valuable Player in 2015 and 2016 and helped spark Golden State 
    to titles in 2015, 2017 and 2018. <br> <br>
    Anthony, a 37-year-old forward, will join a revamped Lakers roster that will also include star guard Russell Westbrook and veteran 
    center Dwight Howard plus Malik Monk, Trevor Ariza, Wayne Ellington and Kent Bazemore. <br> <br>
    Three-time Olympic champion Anthony averaged 13.1 points and 3.1 rebounds last season for the Portland Trail Blazers and hit 40.9%
     from 3-point range. <br> <br>
    Anthony enters his 20th NBA campaign still searching for his first title after stints with Denver, New York, Oklahoma City, Houston
     and Portland. <br> <br>
    But this will be the first time he plays in the NBA alongside James, a former Olympic teammate who like Anthony entered the league
     in 2003. <br> <br>

<h3> Examining Russell Westbrook's fit with the Los Angeles Lakers </h3>
<div class="lak">
<img class="lakers" src="https://phantom-marca.unidadeditorial.es/7d20f392a2fb6ed6ddd7c17faf81431a/resize/1320/f/jpg/assets/multimedia/imagenes/2021/08/03/16280216023434.jpg" width ="400px">
<b>
 Russell Westbrook is a Los Angeles Laker. <br> <br>
 We got draft night magic on Thursday, with the Washington Wizards sending Westbrook and two second-rounders (2024, 2028) to the Lakers
 for Kentavious Caldwell-Pope, Kyle Kuzma, Montrezl Harrell and the 22nd pick of this year's draft (Isaiah Jackson). 
 Jackson was later traded to the Indiana Pacers for Aaron Holiday and the 31st pick of the draft (Isaiah Todd). <br> <br>
But enough pick minutiae: Westbrook is slated to share the floor with LeBron James and Anthony Davis. <br> <br>
The Lakers entered the offseason looking to revise the roster, and kicked things off with one heck of a splash. Adding that level of 
star power without giving up a premier asset -- Kuzma is fine, but far from a blue-chipper -- is always a win on the surface. <br> <br>
But basketball teams aren't built on the surface, nor can they really be evaluated on paper. <br> <br>
Westbrook is, and has been for quite a while, a polarizing player in the league. If there's a list of surefire Hall-of-Famers that
have been more heavily scrutinized than him -- including by your's truly -- then there's no way it's longer than, like, three people. <br> <br>

<h3>Antetokounmpo out for crucial game five: Bucks</h3>
<div class="ant">

<b>
Antetokounmpo, who suffered a hyperextended left knee during the Bucks defeat to Atlanta on Tuesday, had initially been
listed as doubtful for game five in Milwaukee. <br> <br>
However the Bucks confirmed on Thursday the 26-year-old Greek player would now miss the game, where the Bucks will be aiming
to regain the initiative in the best-of-seven series, which is level at 2-2. <br> <br>
Two-time NBA Most Valuable Player Antetokounmpo underwent an MRI and physical examination on Wednesday. <br> <br>
US reports have said the scan found no evidence of structural damage in Antetokounmpo's knee, which twisted as he landed awkwardly
during a defensive play on Tuesday. <br> <br>
The winner of the Eastern Conference finals series will face the Phoenix Suns in the NBA finals which start next week. <br> <br>

<h3>NBA Pacers agree to terms to bring back Carlisle as coach</h3>
<h6>The Indiana Pacers have reached a deal to bring back Rick Carlisle for a second stint as head coach of the NBA club, announcing the agreement on Tuesday.</h6>
<div class="car">
  <img class="carlisle" src="https://images.beinsports.com/koVtele2U71Zjv40q5uKqRiUiBE=/full-fit-in/1000x0/3848849-2021-02-02T042305Z_1168132631_MT1USATODAY15516762_RTRMADP_3_NBA-PHOENIX-SUNS-AT-DALLAS-MAVERICKS.JPG" width ="400px">
  <b>
    Carlisle, 61, guided the Pacers to a 181-147 record over four seasons from 2003-07. In the 2003-04 campaign, he guided the Pacers 
    to a club-record 61 wins and reached the Eastern Conference finals. <br> <br>
    He also served as an assistant coach under NBA legend Larry Bird from 1997-2000, a run capped with the team's only NBA Finals 
    appearance, a loss to the Los Angeles Lakers. <br> <br>
    "Rick is a proven winner with a championship and will be a Hall of Fame coach," Pacers president of basketball operations Kevin 
    Pritchard said in a statement. <br> <br>
    "He has demonstrated throughout his career an ability to build something with sustainable success. He has great respect for our
    franchise and our fans from his previous times here. We are very happy to welcome him back to Indiana." <br> <br>
    Over 19 seasons as an NBA head coach, including stays with the Detroit Pistons from 2001-03 and the Dallas Mavericks from 2008 until 
    stepping down a week ago, Carlisle has compiled a record of 836-689. <br> <br>
    Carlisle, ranked 15th in NBA history for coaching victories, was named NBA Coach of the Year in 2002 and he guided the Mavericks to 
    their first NBA title in 2011. <br> <br>
    "My sincere thanks to Herb Simon, Kevin Pritchard and the entire Pacers organization for the opportunity to come back to basketball's
    heartland," Carlisle said. <br> <br>
