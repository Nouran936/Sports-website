        Three-time Olympic champion Sun Yang had his eight-year ban from swimming overturned by the Swiss Federal Tribunal. <br> <br>
        Sun, 29, was initially handed the suspension in February after the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) upheld the World
         Anti-Doping Agency's (WADA) appeal against the decision from FINA, the international swimming federation, to clear the 
         Chinese swimmer of wrongdoing over allegations stemming from a visit to his home by out-of-competition testers in September
          2018. <br> <br>
        But the Swiss Federal Tribunal overturned the ban, WADA confirmed on Wednesday. <br > <br>
        "The Swiss Federal Tribunal's decision upholds a challenge against the Chair of the CAS Panel and makes no comment on the
         substance of this case," a WADA statement read. <br> <br>
        "In the CAS award, WADA clearly prevailed on the substance of the case as it was able to show that there were a number of 
        aspects of the original FINA decision that were incorrect under the World Anti-Doping Code and the related International 
        Standard for Testing and Investigations. <br> <br>
        "WADA will take steps to present its case robustly again when the matter returns to the CAS Panel, which will be chaired by a
         different president. <br> <br>
        "At this stage, WADA has not received the Tribunal’s full reasoned decision and therefore cannot comment further." <br> <br>
        Sun is a six-time Olympic medallist, including winning two golds at London 2012 and another in Rio four years later. <br> <br>
      He is also an 11-time world champion, most recently doing the 200-metre and 400-metre freestyle double in Gwangju in 2019. <br> <br>

<b>
    Australian swimmer Shayna Jack was pulled out of the World Aquatics Championships after testing positive for a banned substance,
     it has emerged. <br> <br>
    The 20-year-old, who was a 4x100 metres freestyle relay gold medallist at the Commonwealth Games last year, returned an adverse 
    result on June 26, Swimming Australia said. <br> <br>
    The Australian Sports Anti-Doping Authority (ASADA) test took place out of competition and Swimming Australia imposed a provisional
     suspension of Jack. <br> <br>
    She was flown home from a team training camp in Japan and cut from Australia's squad, announcing on July 14 she was withdrawing
     from the World Championships in Gwangju for "personal reasons". <br> <br>
    Details of the substance in question have not been disclosed. <br> <br>
    Swimming Australia chief executive Leigh Russell said: "As you would expect we are bitterly disappointed with allegations a swimmer
     has a prohibited substance in her system although it is important to point out that the matter is yet to be determined. We will 
     continue to provide appropriate support for Shayna." <br> <br>

<h3>Caeleb Dressel</h3>
<h6>Seven up! Dressel matches Phelps' record world championship medal haul</h6>
<div class="new">

  <b>
    Caeleb Dressel's stunning success at the FINA World Championships culminated in the American swimmer matching Michael Phelps' 
    record haul of seven gold medals on the final day of action in Budapest. <br> <br> 
Already the star of the meeting after becoming the first man to win three golds in a single session on Saturday, Dressel picked up
 yet another title 24 hours later as part of his country's men's 4x100-metre medley relay team. <br> <br>
The 20-year-old swam the butterfly leg for the United States, with Matt Grevers (backstroke), Kevin Cordes (breaststroke) and Nathan
 Adrian (freestyle) the other contributors to a successful title defence. <br> <br>
A time of three minutes and 27.91 seconds saw the USA beat Great Britain by just over a second, with Russia taking bronze. <br> <br>
Lilly King was the standout performer on Sunday, winning the 50m breaststroke title ahead of Russian rival Yulia Efimova and Katie
 Meili in a world record time of 29.40secs. <br> <br>
King also swam the breaststroke leg as the USA's victorious women's 4x100m medley team set another world record, while Chase Kalisz 
took gold in the men's 400m individual medley. <br> <br>
Sweden's Sarah Sjostrom followed up her 50m and 100m butterfly successes by earning a third gold in the women's 50m freestyle, her time
 of 23.69s marginally slower than the world record of 23.67s she managed in the semi-finals. <br> <br>
Camille Lacourt won France a belated first gold in the men's 50m backstroke, home favourite Katinka Hosszu continued her dominance of
 the women's 400m individual medley and Gregorio Paltrinieri retained his title in the men's 1500m freestyle. <br> <br>
