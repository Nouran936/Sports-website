      <p class="new">Mohamed Salah scored one and provided two assists as Liverpool got their Premier League title bid off to a winning start with a comfortable victory at newly promoted Norwich City. <br>

Salah got his side's third to become the first player to score on the opening weekend in five consecutive Premier League campaigns and cap a fine display after earlier setting up Diogo Jota and Roberto Firmino.

The Reds were boosted before kick off by the return of talismanic defender Virgil van Dijk after 10 months out through injury and their day got even better when they took the lead midway through the first half.

Trent Alexander-Arnold found Salah inside the box and the Egypt forward's touch fell into the path of Jota for the Portugal forward to finish clinically.

Van Dijk relief at return after "mentally tough" 10 months out
It was a little harsh on Norwich, who had made a spirited start to the game as they were roared on by a buoyant home crowd making the most of their return to Carrow Road and the top flight.

Teemu Pukki, who scored 11 goals in the Premier League two seasons ago, drew an early save out of Alisson after getting in behind the visitors' defence.

But once Liverpool went in front they rarely looked in danger of letting their lead slip as Norwich struggled to rediscover their early rhythm.</p>

    <p class="neww">The Portugal midfielder opened the scoring on the half-hour at a packed Old Trafford, but Luke Ayling's thunderous strike drew Leeds level early in the second half.

Mason Greenwood restored the hosts' lead with a crisp finish less than two minutes later, before Fernandes' low shot was ruled to have crossed the line by referee Paul Tierney after a check of goalline technology.

The 26-year-old quickly completed his hat-trick with a thumping finish from Victor Lindelof's pass, before Fred added United's fourth goal in 14 minutes from Paul Pogba's cross - the Frenchman's fourth assist of the afternoon.
       It was Fernandes' first hat-trick since he moved to Old Trafford in January 2020 and only the second by a Red Devils player since Robin van Persie's title-winning effort against Aston Villa in 2013.

But the game was also a personal triumph for Pogba.

The France midfielder's future has been the subject of intense debate as he enters the final year of his contract.

But his four assists included a sublime pass for Greenwood's goal, and he left the field to a standing ovation 15 minutes from time as £74m new-boy Jadon Sancho was introduced for his debut. </p>

    <p>Tottenham 1-0 Manchester City: Son leads Kane-less Spurs as champions get off to rocky start
Son Heung-min delivered the goods for Tottenham in the absence of Harry Kane as he sealed a 1-0 win over Premier League champions Manchester City in Nuno Espirito Santo's first match at the helm.<br>

Kane, who has been strongly linked with a move to City, was reportedly deemed not sharp enough after only recently returning to training, but Spurs adapted well to the situation after a shaky start against a visiting side who handed a debut to British record signing Jack Grealish.<br>



What does it mean? Wasteful City need options in attack

While the £100million signing of Grealish will surely be worthy, it looks as though City are going to need more if they are to take themselves to the next level, with their inability to find the net despite their expected goals being almost double that of Spurs (1.0 v 1.8).

While Ferran Torres has occasionally done a job leading the line for City, he is not a central striker and Gabriel Jesus does not seem to have convinced Guardiola in that position either, otherwise he would surely have started.

Kane is the obvious option – perhaps after seeing this match play out, Guardiola will have renewed desire to get him in as soon as possible.

Son shines without Kane

In the past few years, a lot of the praise that has come Son's way has often related to his relationship with Kane, rather than the merits of his own quality. Although he seemed strangely subdued early on, he soon got himself on the front foot and proved a real nuisance to City, his five shots more than anyone else on the pitch, and one of those was the excellent goal.

Mendy makes a meal of defensive work

While there were a few situations early on where Benjamin Mendy's ability in attack looked useful, defensively he appeared a weak link throughout. He gifted possession back to Spurs in dangerous positions a couple of times, and was nowhere to be seen for Son's goal on the break.

What's next?

Spurs go to Pacos Ferreira for the first leg of their Conference League qualifier on Thursday before Nuno reunites with Wolves at Molineux next Sunday. City host promoted Norwich City in six days' time.</p>

        <div class="ph5">
    <img class="ph51" src="/photos/kane.jpg">
    
    
    <p>Manchester City's interest in signing Tottenham's Harry Kane is widely known but a deal appears no closer to materialising. 

The 28-year-old forward was absent for the two sides' Premier League game on Sunday, when Spurs took the points.

City have reportedly bid up to £125 million to sign the England international, who reportedly requested a move late last season.

TOP STORY - KANE FRUSTRATED AS SPURS REJECT CITY BID

Kane has grown frustrated with Tottenham chairman Daniel Levy and thrown down the gauntlet with a proposed move to Manchester City, reports The Telegraph.

According to the report, the England forward feels that Levy has not honoured their meeting at the end of the 2019-20 season when he requested to leave Spurs if they underachieved.

Kane is also frustrated that Levy's tactics have seen fans turned against him and that the chairman is also refusing to sell or even accept calls from City.

The report claims that City have submitted a fresh £125m bid for Kane, which Spurs have turned down.</p>

  <h1 class="l1"> karim Benzema extends Real Madrid deal until 2023 - club</h1>
    <div class="ll1">
  <img class="lph1" src="/photos/bezo.jpg">
        <p>Veteran French striker Karim Benzema signed a new deal with Real Madrid that will keep him at the La Liga club until 2023, the Spanish outfit said on Friday.
        The versatile 33-year-old forward joined Madrid back in 2009 from Lyon and he has racked up an impressive 560 matches for them since. He is currently in his 13th season and was voted La Liga player of the year last season.

After a televised signing ceremony where a best of Benzema video was played the striker posed for a photograph with Real president Florentino Perez with the pair holding up a shirt with Benzema's name and the number 2023 on it.

"The story continues for me at the greatest club in the world," Benzema said.

"What an honour to be here today, thank you for trusting me over the years," he said.

The club thanked Benzema for his long and brilliant service to them
"The French striker has won everything possible in a Madrid shirt with a massive 19 titles: four Champions Leagues, four Club World Cups, three European Super Cups, three Liga, two Spanish Cups and three Spanish Super Cups," the club said.

"With his football he has won the hearts of all Madrid supporters."

Benzema was long in the shadow of Ronaldo and Sergio Ramos, but since the Portuguese left for Juventus three years ago the French international has thrived.

With Ramos also out of the picture since his move to Paris Saint-Germain, Benzema is now the club's senior star player.

One of the eye-catching details of Benzema's new contract was the size of the release clause, at one billion euros.</p>

    <div class="ll2">
    <img class="lph2" src="/photos/martin23jpg.jpg">
    
    
    <p>Barcelona started life without Lionel Messi by defeating Real Sociedad 4-2 in their La Liga opener at the Camp Nou on Sunday.
Captain Gerard Pique gave them a 19th minute lead with Martin Braithwaite finding the net in first half injury time and in the 59th minute. Sergi Roberto added a fourth in the last minute of the game.

Just over 20,000 fans were in attendance as crowds returned for the first time since the pandemic.

Six-time Ballon d'Or winner Messi called time on his two-decade career at Barcelona last week and moved to Paris Saint-Germain.
    Gerard Pique led from the front as Barcelona put all the gloom and doom of Lionel Messi's departure to one side to win a six-goal thriller at the Camp Nou.

It was Pique taking a pay-cut on Friday that enabled Barcelona to register Memphis Depay and the former Manchester United and Lyon striker repaid him the favour on 19 minutes when he whipped in a free-kick that Pique headed past Neto for the opening goal.

'It means a lot to me,' said Pique of his wage sacrifice after the game. 'I have grown up here, I played here for a long time and lived here for most of my life. It was the gesture that was required.'He also said that other club captains Jordi Alba, Sergi Busquets and Sergio Roberto were about to make similar gestures. 'I have been in contact with the other captains and they will take the same steps soon. It was a question of timing that I did it first but we are all prepared to make the necessary adjustments.</p>

    <div class="ll3">
        
        <img class="lph3" src="/photos/Aguero.jpg"/>
        
        <p>Barcelona's nightmare has continued after it was confirmed Sergio Aguero is likely to be out until mid-October due to a calf injury.

Already having to contend with the unexpected departure of talisman Lionel Messi, Barca are in a dire financial situation heading into the new season.

They will now also be without one of their new arrivals for up to 10 weeks, though LaLiga's salary restrictions have meant Barca have not yet been able to register Aguero, who joined on a free transfer from Premier League champions Manchester City.

The 33-year-old left City after 10 years with the club, but his final season was hampered by injury and COVID-19 lay offs.

He managed only eight starts in 2020-21, playing 720 minutes in total across 20 appearances in all competitions.

Aguero's tally of six goals – two of which came from the penalty spot – was by far the fewest he managed for City since joining in 2011. Indeed, his previous low was 17, in the 2012-13 season.

His Barca career has now stalled before it has even started.

Reports in Spain on Monday suggested Aguero had already been expected to miss a month due to the injury, but further tests had revealed a tendon tear in his inner right calf – this was subsequently confirmed by Barca.

"Tests carried out on first-team player Kun Aguero have confirmed a right calf injury. He will be out around 10 weeks," a Barca statement read.

Aguero will miss Barca's opening nine LaLiga fixtures and at least the first two rounds of the Champions League group stage.

Reports emerged over the weekend that Aguero wished to leave Barca already, with the possibility of playing with his good friend and compatriot Messi having been a major factor in his decision to sign on at Camp Nou.

On Sunday, Aguero posted a farewell message to Messi on his official Instagram account.

"All the best in whatever comes my friend. And always with that smile. I love you," the post read.

Barca kick-off their LaLiga campaign – and the post-Messi era against Real Sociedad on Sunday.</p>

Valencia overcame a third-minute red card to beat Getafe 1-0 in a bruising opening game in Spain's La Liga on Friday.

Defender Hugo Guillamon was given a straight red for a dangerous tackle on Getafe's Serbian midfielder Nemanja Maksimovic.

After the referee consulted a video replay, it was the fastest sending off in the history of Liga season openers.

The foul itself had been committed after just 39 seconds of the game.

Eight minutes after Guillamon's dismissal, Valencia were ahead.

Russian winger Denis Cheryshev was brought down in the penalty area and Carlos Soler tucked away the spot-kick.

Valencia goalkeeper Giorgi Mamardashvili, on loan from Dinamo Tbilisi, pulled off two fine saves late in the game to deny Getafe an equalising goal.

Getafe's misery was completed when Erick Cabaco was sent off for a second yellow card in the 76th minute.

        <p>Lionel Messi and Neymar have been training together in Paris, invoking fond memories of their Barcelona partnership.Lionel Messi and Neymar have been training together for Paris Saint-Germain, but Mauricio Pochettino refused to comment whether the pair would feature against Brest.

PSG travel to Brest on Friday fresh from back-to-back Ligue 1 wins against Troyes and Strasbourg, the first time in three years they have begun a new domestic season in such fashion.

Despite a positive start to their campaign, interest continues to centre around Messi, who arrived in Paris after a shock exit from Barcelona amid the club's financial difficulties in August.

However, it remains unclear whether the highly anticipated pairing of Messi and Neymar will be reunited to form a formidable trio with Kylian Mbappe at Stade Francis-Le Ble.

"We haven’t decided the squad yet but we will do so shortly," Pochettino responded in Thursday's news conference when asked about Messi.

"We will analyse whether he can be in the squad. In terms of what Lionel Messi brings, everybody knows that.

"His presence here in terms of what he represents is something we have talked about a lot in recent days.

"I am pleased with how he has settled in and how he has connected with squad. When you have talent at this sort of club, the understanding is not just in the dressing room but also on the pitch."

As part of a fearsome frontline with Luis Suarez at Barcelona between 2014 and 2017, Messi and Neymar between them created 2.1 chances for one another per 90 minutes, resulting in 22 assists for the duo.

But, like Suarez when he moved to Barcelona, it is Messi who will have to quickly link-up with an already established pairing, Mbappe and Neymar.

Neymar's injury troubles have meant that he and Mbappe have only played 3,552 minutes together – less than half as many as Messi and Suarez – though they have combined for 102 chances (2.6 per 90) and 21 assists (one every 169 minutes).

However, as with questioning over Messi's inclusion, Pochettino kept his cards close to his chest as to whether Neymar would feature. </p>

        <p>Messi gets rapturous reception before watching PSG beat Strasbourg.Lionel Messi got a first proper taste of his new home on Saturday as he was presented to a full stadium of Paris Saint-Germain fans before watching his team-mates beat Strasbourg 4-2 in Ligue 1 with Kylian Mbappe playing a starring role.

Messi received a rapturous reception as he ran out onto the pitch along with PSG's other summer signings, with a 48,000-full house greeting the six-time Ballon d'Or winner despite the welcome ceremony taking place an hour before kick-off.

Messi joined fellow recruits Sergio Ramos, Gianluigi Donnarumma, Georginio Wijnaldum and Achraf Hakimi on a stage set up on the turf at the Parc des Princes, with the flashy presentation ceremony threatening to overshadow the match itself.

The Argentine later watched from the stands alongside Neymar and Angel di Maria -- the trio not yet considered match-fit having enjoyed an extended break after playing at the Copa America -- as Mauricio Pochettino's team survived something of a scare to beat Strasbourg and make it two wins from two Ligue 1 matches this season.

They led 3-0 at half-time thanks to goals by Mauro Icardi and Julian Draxler either side of a Ludovic Ajorque own goal, but Kevin Gameiro and Ajorque netted after the interval to bring the visitors back into the contest.

However Pablo Sarabia made sure of the win late on after Strasbourg had been reduced to 10 men in the first match played before a full house at the Parc des Princes since before the Covid-19 pandemic struck in March last year.
                  
However Mbappe played a key part in PSG's victory, which looked a certainty from the moment Icardi headed in Abdou Diallo's cross in the third minute.

The second goal arrived in the 25th minute when Mbappe's shot went in via a cruel deflection off the face of Ajorque, and two minutes later it was Mbappe's cross that was turned in at the back post by Draxler. </p>

Monaco, who finished third last season to earn a chance of a place Champions League, left a number of senior players on the bench ahead of their Champions League qualifying playoff first leg against Shakhtar Donetsk on Tuesday.

Moffi was brought down by Monaco summer signing Ismail Jakobs after 31 minutes and took the penalty to score. Moffi was Lorient's top scorer last season with 14 goals, three of them against Monaco.

Monaco dominated possession but struggled to create clear chances. The few strikes on target they managed were blocked by the in-form goalkeeper Paul Nardi.

In front of more than 12,000 spectators, delighted to be back at the Moustoir stadium after almost a season behind closed doors, and increasingly excited as victory approached, Lorient held on to their small lead.</p>

Messi this week completed his stunning free transfer to PSG having left Barcelona.

The deal was completed on Tuesday, before the six-time Ballon d'Or winner faced the media on Wednesday. On Thursday, he was able to link up with his new team-mates.

On their official Instagram page, PSG posted a short video clip to their story showing Messi going through running drills.

Meanwhile, Mbappe – whose contract talks are now the club's chief focus – posted pictures of an embrace with the 34-year-old great.

"Welcome to Paris, Leo," he wrote, adding a further caption on his story: "Legend."

PSG are expected to move some squad players out to offset the cost of Messi's deal and a tentative first transfer was secured on Thursday.

Timothee Pembele, the 18-year-old defender who featured six times in Ligue 1 for PSG last season, has joined Bordeaux on loan until the end of the season.

Bordeaux have the option to sign Pembele permanently, too, with a PSG statement telling the teenager to "develop the qualities he has already shown". </p>
